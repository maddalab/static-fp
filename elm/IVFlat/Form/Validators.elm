  Note: there's a bug in 0.18 Elm such that `String.toInt "-"`
  produces a `NaN` rather than an error. Moreover, `isNan` doesn't
  work on it - it expects a Float.
  https://github.com/elm-lang/core/issues/831

  Because NaN is larger than any value, `a >= 0` check succeeds
  for the input "-". NaN is smaller than any value, so we ask
  if the parse result is less than maxint which, alas, is only
  available from Random.
