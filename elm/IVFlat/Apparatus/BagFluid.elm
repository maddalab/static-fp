{- The bag is the source of fluid. During an animation, the level of
fluid can lower, or the whole bag can empty (which triggers emptying
of the chamber and hose).

Note that the bag may start out not completely filled. There's a
distinction between the "bag" and the "bag fluid".

{- In the real app, draining is proportional to the time the user chose.
Without a spinning clock, that's visually confusing, so all draining takes
this much time.

The client still passes in the time, but it's ignored. (Because I may yet
add the spinning clock.) So this is the duration for all these animations.
