module Scratch exposing (..)

-- Elm automatically imports modules like `List` and `String`.
-- Others need to be specifically imported. Here's an example:
import Tuple

-- An example function
length2 list1 list2 =
  List.length list1 + List.length list2

{- 
Functions defined here are easy to use in the repl. Here are two ways:

1. A plain import requires that you use the module name to refer to
   module functions.

> import Scratch
> Scratch.length2 [1, 2] ["3", "4"]
4 : Int

2. You can ask for everything in the module to be exposed so the
   module name isn't needed.

> import Scratch exposing (..)
> length2 [1, 2] ["3", "4"]
4 : Int

If you change something in this file, repeat the `import` statement to
make it available. NOTE: if you use the `exposing` form, and you want
the changed functions to stay available without qualification by the
module name, you have to repeat the whole line, including `exposing (..)`.
